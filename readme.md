PicSync Server
======================

PicSync automatically uploads photos you take on on your phone to a private online album. 
Later, when you log into facebook, the app notifies you of new photos allowing you to 
review them and post your favorites.

This is the server package. It's written in node.js to run on Heroku and S3.

so it is not currently open source. (Not in the traditional sense anyways.)
